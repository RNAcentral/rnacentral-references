# RNAcentral References
This repository contains a simple API to explore [EuropePMC](https://europepmc.org/) articles. 

## Installation

###  Using docker-compose

1. `git clone https://github.com/RNAcentral/rnacentral-references.git`
2. `cd rnacentral-references`
3. create an `.env` file with the following environment variables (keep ENVIRONMENT=DOCKER and change LITSCAN_USER,
LITSCAN_PASSWORD and LITSCAN_DB as desired).
```
ENVIRONMENT=DOCKER
LITSCAN_USER=docker
LITSCAN_PASSWORD=example
LITSCAN_DB=reference
```
4. `docker-compose up --build`

A volume is being used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. 
If you want to recreate the database, just run the `docker-compose down --volumes` command before step 4. 

### Using local virtual environment

1. `git clone https://github.com/RNAcentral/rnacentral-references.git`
2. `cd rnacentral-references`
3. `python3 -m venv venv`
4. `source venv/bin/activate`
5. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
6. `docker build -t local-postgres database/local` - this will create an image with postgres databases.
7. `docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -t local-postgres` - this will create and start an 
instance of postgres on your local machine's 5432 port.
8. `python3 -m database` - creates necessary database tables
9. `python3 -m producer` - starts producer server on port 8080
10. `python3 -m consumer` - starts consumer server on port 8081

## How it works?

Submit a single job using
```
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{\"id\": \"RF00001\"}" localhost:8080/api/submit-job
```

This job will use the following query on EuropePMC:
```
query=("RF00001" AND ("rna" OR "mrna" OR "ncrna" OR "lncrna" OR "rrna" OR "sncrna") AND IN_EPMC:Y AND OPEN_ACCESS:Y AND NOT SRC:PPR)
```

Where:
1. `"RF00001"` is the string used in the search
2. `("rna" OR "mrna" OR "ncrna" OR "lncrna" OR "rrna" OR "sncrna")` is used to filter out possible false positives
3. `IN_EPMC:Y` means that the full text of the article is available in Europe PMC
4. `OPEN_ACCESS:Y` it must be an Open Access article to allow access to the full content
5. `NOT SRC:PPR` cannot be a Preprint, as preprints are not peer-reviewed

It is possible to change the query used to filter out possible false positives.
To do so, use the `query` parameter when submitting a job
```
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{\"id\": \"RF00001\", \"query\": \"('foo' AND 'bar')\"}" localhost:8080/api/submit-job
```

Or if you don't want to use any queries, run
```
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{\"id\": \"RF00001\", \"query\": \"\"}" localhost:8080/api/submit-job
```

Use the `search_limit` parameter if you want to set a maximum number of articles to search when testing this tool
```
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{\"id\": \"RF00001\", \"search_limit\": 10}" localhost:8080/api/submit-job
```

To rescan an id, use the `rescan` parameter
```
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{\"id\": \"RF00001\", \"rescan\": true}" localhost:8080/api/submit-job
```

To submit multiple ids run
```
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{\"job_id\": [\"5S rRNA\", \"5S ribosomal RNA\"], \"database\": \"rfam\", \"primary_id\": \"RF00001\", \"search_limit\": 10}" localhost:8080/api/multiple-jobs
```

The example above is useful for submitting a collection of identifiers (Ids) related to a single gene/accession.
Note that the URL used in this case is `localhost:8080/api/multiple-jobs`.

You can check the results by accessing the URL
```
http://localhost:8080/api/results/rf00001
```

### Rate limit from the EuropePMC API

Current rate limit is **10 requests per second** or **500 per minute**. We are making at least 200 requests per minute 
when this tool is used. If a consumer is searching for an ID that has many articles, this VM can make up to 
100 requests per minute. The vast majority of IDs searched do not have articles, so the rate limit is unlikely 
to be exceeded.
